# EspressoLabs ☕️

Welcome to EspressoLabs' GitHub organization! ☕️

## Tech Stack

### Language
We use TypeScript throughout our entire stack to ensure type safety and enhance developer experience. This unified approach allows us to share types between frontend and backend, reducing redundancy and potential errors.

### Backend
Our backend is powered by Node.js with Express.js, providing a robust and scalable server-side foundation. We leverage TypeScript's strong typing to create maintainable and reliable APIs.

### Coding Standards
We follow the Airbnb JavaScript/TypeScript Style Guide to maintain consistency across all our projects. This helps us write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (we recommend using the LTS version)
2. Set up TypeScript in your development environment
3. Familiarize yourself with our coding standards:
   - [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
4. Set up VScode extension + coPilot.
5. TODO - extensions

## Contributing

1. Talk about the changes with the Tech Lead(s). After you get a 'green light' go to the next step.
2. Create a new branch for your feature.
3. Make your changes.
4. Ensure your code follows our style guidelines.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Branch Naming Convention
We maintain a consistent branch naming strategy to easily identify the purpose of each branch:

### Feature Branches
For new features, use the following format:

```
feature/[issue-number]-short-feature-description

Examples:
feature/123-user-authentication
feature/456-payment-integration
```


### Bug Fix Branches
For bug fixes, use the following format:
Copyfix/[issue-number]-short-bug-description

Examples:
```
fix/789-login-crash
fix/101-incorrect-pricing-calculation
```
